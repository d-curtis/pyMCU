# pyMCU

This is a python library to interact with DAW controllers implementing a certain MIDI-based comms protocol.
I'm working on this on my own as a fun little hobby project, and also as part of a wider hacked-together solution for my own home studio requirements.


## Project Status

__01.11.24__
Very much a work in progress. Basic low-level functionality is there, the comms classes all seem to work.
Next up, working on the controller class and setting up a more abstract API to make this actually usable.
